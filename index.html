  <h2>Hi there! I'm a senior double-majoring in Digital Narrative & Interactive Design and Psychology,
    with a Certificate in Children's Literature and Studies. I am hoping to pursue a degree in the Human-Computer
    Interaction (HCI) field and am very much looking forward to learning more about accessible and inclusive design
    during my last semester here at Pitt. Along with this course, I am also taking a User-Centered Design course that
    will help further immerse myself into the field.</h2>

  <h2>Below is a picture of my first ever service dog in training (SDiT) that I am currently raising for national nonprofit organization, Canine Companions.

  <h2>My professional ambition is to become a UX designer and to get a chance to work on the design of new products and services that are engaging, easy-to-use and that help improve people's lives and society as a whole. A particular interest of mine revolves around issues of accessibility and the design of solutions for people who are physically or mentally impaired. I want to help make our world more welcoming to all and I believe that UX is incredibly useful to better understand ways in which I can think and design solutions to help various communities.</h2>
